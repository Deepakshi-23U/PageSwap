# PageSwap

This page replacement algorithm visualizer🔁 is developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates the functioning of three prominent algorithms: First-In-First-Out (FIFO), Least Recently Used (LRU), and Most Recently Used (MRU).

✨Moreover, the visualizer employs captivating animations to illustrate the occurrence of page hits and page faults, thereby enhancing the user's understanding of these fundamental concepts.✨

📄This visualizer allows users to gain valuable insights into the behavior of these page replacement algorithms. The FIFO algorithm, based on the principle of replacing the oldest page in memory, the LRU algorithm, focused on evicting the least recently accessed page, and the MRU algorithm, centered around discarding the most recently accessed page, are all effectively depicted through intuitive animations.📄
